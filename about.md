<p>I am currently enrolled in MSc Digital Sociology at the University of Edinburgh, where I am also the Programme Representative for my cohort. I hold a BA in English and Philosophy from the University of Sheffield, have a background in STEM, and am a published poet. My research integrates computational social science techniques into mixed-methods analyses of large-scale cultural phenomena, such as podcasting.
